<blockquote>
<p>The Mathematics Strand underpins most of the other strands: its purpose is to provide a rigorous foundation for many of the more applied concepts met in the other Strands. As such it is offered early in the course. </p>
<p>Discrete Mathematics represents a breath first rather than depth first treatment of concepts such as logic (cf. Programming), complexity and recurrence (cf. Algorithms), sets (cf. Data Structures), enumeration (cf. Statistics), relations (cf. Databases) and graphs (cf. Algorithms and Networking). Its purpose is to ensure that all students have a basic mathematical literacy in such topics. In such a one semester course, the treatment will necessarily be at an introductory level, but the concepts will be covered in greater depth later in the course, mainly in modules on other Strands</p>
