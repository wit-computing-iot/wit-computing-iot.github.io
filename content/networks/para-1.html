<p>The network, its configuration, management, and evolution, is at the heart of the IoT. Whether fixed, wireless, ad-hoc, sensor based, or hybrid, intelligent services and applications will derive much of their power from their participation in a secure and robust network. In this context, identity, privacy and trust are inherently bound into the hardware and software systems, which will embody key security principles in their operation and management. Given the magnitude and diversity of devices, network infrastructure automation and programmable infrastructure (a.k.a. infrastructure as code) are critical components of the IoT.</p>
