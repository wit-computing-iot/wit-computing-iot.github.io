<blockquote>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to generate massive amounts of data that will demonstrate most of the characteristics of the Big Data. A single IoT system will incorporate a multitude of diverse devices generating a constant stream of data relevant to a variety of IoT applications. While most of the data will hold short term practical value (e.g. temperature readings, air pressure values), deep analysis of the historical data can provide a meaningful insight of high potential value. Such insight may relate to a particular IoT application (e.g. business analytics) as well as operation of the IoT system itself (operational analytics). The analysis of the IoT data will encompass descriptive, predictive and prescriptive business analytics with operational analytics closely linked to the growth of the IoT system. Operational analytics will be driven by data that is sourced from all things included into the IoT system. Consequently the IoT requires a new skill-set for data governance and analyses.</p>
